-->

* `command` {string} The command to run.
* `options` {Object}
  * `cwd` {string} Current working directory of the child process.
  * `input` {string|Buffer|Uint8Array} The value which will be passed as stdin
    to the spawned process.
    - supplying this value will override `stdio[0]`.
  * `stdio` {string|Array} Child's stdio configuration. **Default:** `'pipe'`
    - `stderr` by default will be output to the parent process' stderr unless
      `stdio` is specified
  * `env` {Object} Environment key-value pairs.
  * `shell` {string} Shell to execute the command with.
    **Default:** `'/bin/sh'` on UNIX, `process.env.ComSpec` on Windows. See
    [Shell Requirements][] and [Default Windows Shell][].
  * `uid` {number} Sets the user identity of the process. (See setuid(2)).
  * `gid` {number} Sets the group identity of the process. (See setgid(2)).
  * `timeout` {number} In milliseconds the maximum amount of time the process
    is allowed to run. **Default:** `undefined`
  * `killSignal` {string|integer} The signal value to be used when the spawned
    process will be killed. **Default:** `'SIGTERM'`
  * `maxBuffer` {number} Largest amount of data in bytes allowed on stdout or
    stderr. **Default:** `200*1024` If exceeded, the child process is terminated.
    See caveat at [`maxBuffer` and Unicode][].
  * `encoding` {string} The encoding used for all stdio inputs and outputs.
    **Default:** `'buffer'`
  * `windowsHide` {boolean} Hide the subprocess console window that would
    normally be created on Windows systems. **Default:** `false`.
* Returns: {Buffer|string} The stdout from the command.

The `child_process.execSync()` method is generally identical to
[`child_process.exec()`][] with the exception that the method will not return until
the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been encountered and
`killSignal` is sent, the method won't return until the process has completely
exited. *Note that if  the child process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM`
signal and doesn't exit, the parent process will wait until the child
process has exited.*

If the process times out, or has a non-zero exit code, this method ***will***
throw.  The [`Error`][] object will contain the entire result from
[`child_process.spawnSync()`][]

*Note*: Never pass unsanitised user input to this function. Any input
containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command
execution.
