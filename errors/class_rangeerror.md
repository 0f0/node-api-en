A subclass of `Error` that indicates that a provided argument was not within the
set or range of acceptable values for a function; whether that is a numeric
range, or outside the set of options for a given function parameter.

For example:

```js
require('net').connect(-1);
// throws "RangeError: "port" option should be >= 0 and < 65536: -1"
```

Node.js will generate and throw `RangeError` instances *immediately* as a form
of argument validation.
