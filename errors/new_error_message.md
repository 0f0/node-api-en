* `message` {string}

Creates a new `Error` object and sets the `error.message` property to the
provided text message. If an object is passed as `message`, the text message
is generated by calling `message.toString()`. The `error.stack` property will
represent the point in the code at which `new Error()` was called. Stack traces
are dependent on [V8's stack trace API][]. Stack traces extend only to either
(a) the beginning of  *synchronous code execution*, or (b) the number of frames
given by the property `Error.stackTraceLimit`, whichever is smaller.
