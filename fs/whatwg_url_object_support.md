For most `fs` module functions, the `path` or `filename` argument may be passed
as a WHATWG [`URL`][] object. Only [`URL`][] objects using the `file:` protocol
are supported.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const { URL } = require('url');
const fileUrl = new URL('file:///tmp/hello');

fs.readFileSync(fileUrl);
```

*Note*: `file:` URLs are always absolute paths.

Using WHATWG [`URL`][] objects might introduce platform-specific behaviors.

On Windows, `file:` URLs with a hostname convert to UNC paths, while `file:`
URLs with drive letters convert to local absolute paths. `file:` URLs without a
hostname nor a drive letter will result in a throw :

```js
// On Windows :

// - WHATWG file URLs with hostname convert to UNC path
// file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file => \\hostname\p\a\t\h\file
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file'));

// - WHATWG file URLs with drive letters convert to absolute path
// file:///C:/tmp/hello => C:\tmp\hello
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/tmp/hello'));

// - WHATWG file URLs without hostname must have a drive letters
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///notdriveletter/p/a/t/h/file'));
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///c/p/a/t/h/file'));
// TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must be absolute
```

*Note*: `file:` URLs with drive letters must use `:` as a separator just after
the drive letter. Using another separator will result in a throw.

On all other platforms, `file:` URLs with a hostname are unsupported and will
result in a throw:

```js
// On other platforms:

// - WHATWG file URLs with hostname are unsupported
// file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file => throw!
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file'));
// TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: must be absolute

// - WHATWG file URLs convert to absolute path
// file:///tmp/hello => /tmp/hello
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///tmp/hello'));
```

A `file:` URL having encoded slash characters will result in a throw on all
platforms:

```js
// On Windows
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/p/a/t/h/%2F'));
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/p/a/t/h/%2f'));
/* TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must not include encoded
\ or / characters */

// On POSIX
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///p/a/t/h/%2F'));
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///p/a/t/h/%2f'));
/* TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must not include encoded
/ characters */
```
On Windows, `file:` URLs having encoded backslash will result in a throw:

```js
// On Windows
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/path/%5C'));
fs.readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/path/%5c'));
/* TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must not include encoded
\ or / characters */
```
