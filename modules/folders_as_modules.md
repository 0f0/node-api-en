It is convenient to organize programs and libraries into self-contained
directories, and then provide a single entry point to that library.
There are three ways in which a folder may be passed to `require()` as
an argument.

The first is to create a `package.json` file in the root of the folder,
which specifies a `main` module.  An example package.json file might
look like this:

```json
{ "name" : "some-library",
  "main" : "./lib/some-library.js" }
```

If this was in a folder at `./some-library`, then
`require('./some-library')` would attempt to load
`./some-library/lib/some-library.js`.

This is the extent of Node.js's awareness of package.json files.

*Note*: If the file specified by the `"main"` entry of `package.json` is
missing and can not be resolved, Node.js will report the entire module as
missing with the default error:

```txt
Error: Cannot find module 'some-library'
```

If there is no package.json file present in the directory, then Node.js
will attempt to load an `index.js` or `index.node` file out of that
directory.  For example, if there was no package.json file in the above
example, then `require('./some-library')` would attempt to load:

* `./some-library/index.js`
* `./some-library/index.node`
