If the `NODE_PATH` environment variable is set to a colon-delimited list
of absolute paths, then Node.js will search those paths for modules if they
are not found elsewhere.

*Note*: On Windows, `NODE_PATH` is delimited by semicolons instead of colons.

`NODE_PATH` was originally created to support loading modules from
varying paths before the current [module resolution][] algorithm was frozen.

`NODE_PATH` is still supported, but is less necessary now that the Node.js
ecosystem has settled on a convention for locating dependent modules.
Sometimes deployments that rely on `NODE_PATH` show surprising behavior
when people are unaware that `NODE_PATH` must be set.  Sometimes a
module's dependencies change, causing a different version (or even a
different module) to be loaded as the `NODE_PATH` is searched.

Additionally, Node.js will search in the following locations:

* 1: `$HOME/.node_modules`
* 2: `$HOME/.node_libraries`
* 3: `$PREFIX/lib/node`

Where `$HOME` is the user's home directory, and `$PREFIX` is Node.js's
configured `node_prefix`.

These are mostly for historic reasons.

*Note*: It is strongly encouraged to place dependencies in the local
`node_modules` folder. These will be loaded faster, and more reliably.
