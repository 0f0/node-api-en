type: property
name: [index]

The index operator `[index]` can be used to get and set the octet at position
`index` in `buf`. The values refer to individual bytes, so the legal value
range is between `0x00` and `0xFF` (hex) or `0` and `255` (decimal).

This operator is inherited from `Uint8Array`, so its behavior on out-of-bounds
access is the same as `UInt8Array` - that is, getting returns `undefined` and
setting does nothing.

Example: Copy an ASCII string into a `Buffer`, one byte at a time

```js
const str = 'Node.js';
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(str.length);

for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  buf[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
}

// Prints: Node.js
console.log(buf.toString('ascii'));
```
