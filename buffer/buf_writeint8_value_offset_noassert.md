* `value` {integer} Number to be written to `buf`.
* `offset` {integer} Number of bytes to skip before starting to write. Must satisfy: `0 <= offset <= buf.length - 1`.
* `noAssert` {boolean} Skip `value` and `offset` validation? **Default:** `false`
* Returns: {integer} `offset` plus the number of bytes written.

Writes `value` to `buf` at the specified `offset`. `value` *should* be a valid
signed 8-bit integer. Behavior is undefined when `value` is anything other than
a signed 8-bit integer.

Setting `noAssert` to `true` allows the encoded form of `value` to extend beyond
the end of `buf`, but the result should be considered undefined behavior.

`value` is interpreted and written as a two's complement signed integer.

Examples:

```js
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(2);

buf.writeInt8(2, 0);
buf.writeInt8(-2, 1);

// Prints: <Buffer 02 fe>
console.log(buf);
```
