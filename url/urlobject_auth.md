The `auth` property is the username and password portion of the URL, also
referred to as "userinfo". This string subset follows the `protocol` and
double slashes (if present) and precedes the `host` component, delimited by an
ASCII "at sign" (`@`). The format of the string is `{username}[:{password}]`,
with the `[:{password}]` portion being optional.

For example: `'user:pass'`
