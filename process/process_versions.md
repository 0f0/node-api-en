* {Object}

The `process.versions` property returns an object listing the version strings of
Node.js and its dependencies. `process.versions.modules` indicates the current
ABI version, which is increased whenever a C++ API changes. Node.js will refuse
to load modules that were compiled against a different module ABI version.

```js
console.log(process.versions);
```

Will generate an object similar to:

```js
{
  http_parser: '2.3.0',
  node: '1.1.1',
  v8: '4.1.0.14',
  uv: '1.3.0',
  zlib: '1.2.8',
  ares: '1.10.0-DEV',
  modules: '43',
  icu: '55.1',
  openssl: '1.0.1k',
  unicode: '8.0',
  cldr: '29.0',
  tz: '2016b' }
```
