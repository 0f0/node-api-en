    description: Additional arguments after `callback` are now supported.
-->

* `callback` {Function}
* `...args` {any} Additional arguments to pass when invoking the `callback`

The `process.nextTick()` method adds the `callback` to the "next tick queue".
Once the current turn of the event loop turn runs to completion, all callbacks
currently in the next tick queue will be called.

This is *not* a simple alias to [`setTimeout(fn, 0)`][]. It is much more
efficient.  It runs before any additional I/O events (including
timers) fire in subsequent ticks of the event loop.

```js
console.log('start');
process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('nextTick callback');
});
console.log('scheduled');
// Output:
// start
// scheduled
// nextTick callback
```

This is important when developing APIs in order to give users the opportunity
to assign event handlers *after* an object has been constructed but before any
I/O has occurred:

```js
function MyThing(options) {
  this.setupOptions(options);

  process.nextTick(() => {
    this.startDoingStuff();
  });
}

const thing = new MyThing();
thing.getReadyForStuff();

// thing.startDoingStuff() gets called now, not before.
```

It is very important for APIs to be either 100% synchronous or 100%
asynchronous.  Consider this example:

```js
// WARNING!  DO NOT USE!  BAD UNSAFE HAZARD!
function maybeSync(arg, cb) {
  if (arg) {
    cb();
    return;
  }

  fs.stat('file', cb);
}
```

This API is hazardous because in the following case:

```js
const maybeTrue = Math.random() > 0.5;

maybeSync(maybeTrue, () => {
  foo();
});

bar();
```

It is not clear whether `foo()` or `bar()` will be called first.

The following approach is much better:

```js
function definitelyAsync(arg, cb) {
  if (arg) {
    process.nextTick(cb);
    return;
  }

  fs.stat('file', cb);
}
```

*Note*: The next tick queue is completely drained on each pass of the
event loop **before** additional I/O is processed.  As a result,
recursively setting nextTick callbacks will block any I/O from
happening, just like a `while(true);` loop.
