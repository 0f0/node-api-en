* {Stream}

The `process.stdin` property returns a stream connected to
`stdin` (fd `0`). It is a [`net.Socket`][] (which is a [Duplex][]
stream) unless fd `0` refers to a file, in which case it is
a [Readable][] stream.

For example:

```js
process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');

process.stdin.on('readable', () => {
  const chunk = process.stdin.read();
  if (chunk !== null) {
    process.stdout.write(`data: ${chunk}`);
  }
});

process.stdin.on('end', () => {
  process.stdout.write('end');
});
```

As a [Duplex][] stream, `process.stdin` can also be used in "old" mode that
is compatible with scripts written for Node.js prior to v0.10.
For more information see [Stream compatibility][].

*Note*: In "old" streams mode the `stdin` stream is paused by default, so one
must call `process.stdin.resume()` to read from it. Note also that calling
`process.stdin.resume()` itself would switch stream to "old" mode.
