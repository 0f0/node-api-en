Calling [`.flush()`][] on a compression stream will make `zlib` return as much
output as currently possible. This may come at the cost of degraded compression
quality, but can be useful when data needs to be available as soon as possible.

In the following example, `flush()` is used to write a compressed partial
HTTP response to the client:
```js
const zlib = require('zlib');
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  // For the sake of simplicity, the Accept-Encoding checks are omitted.
  response.writeHead(200, { 'content-encoding': 'gzip' });
  const output = zlib.createGzip();
  output.pipe(response);

  setInterval(() => {
    output.write(`The current time is ${Date()}\n`, () => {
      // The data has been passed to zlib, but the compression algorithm may
      // have decided to buffer the data for more efficient compression.
      // Calling .flush() will make the data available as soon as the client
      // is ready to receive it.
      output.flush();
    });
  }, 1000);
}).listen(1337);
```
