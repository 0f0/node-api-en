- `hostname` {string}
- `callback` {Function}
  - `err` {Error}
  - `addresses` {string[]}

Uses the DNS protocol to resolve text queries (`TXT` records) for the
`hostname`. The `addresses` argument passed to the `callback` function is
is a two-dimensional array of the text records available for `hostname` (e.g.,
`[ ['v=spf1 ip4:0.0.0.0 ', '~all' ] ]`). Each sub-array contains TXT chunks of
one record. Depending on the use case, these could be either joined together or
treated separately.
