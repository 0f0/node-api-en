    description: The `all` option is supported now.
-->
- `hostname` {string}
- `options` {integer | Object}
  - `family` {integer} The record family. Must be `4` or `6`. IPv4
    and IPv6 addresses are both returned by default.
  - `hints` {number} One or more [supported `getaddrinfo` flags][]. Multiple
    flags may be passed by bitwise `OR`ing their values.
  - `all` {boolean} When `true`, the callback returns all resolved addresses in
    an array. Otherwise, returns a single address. Defaults to `false`.
- `callback` {Function}
  - `err` {Error}
  - `address` {string} A string representation of an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
  - `family` {integer} `4` or `6`, denoting the family of `address`.

Resolves a hostname (e.g. `'nodejs.org'`) into the first found A (IPv4) or
AAAA (IPv6) record. All `option` properties are optional. If `options` is an
integer, then it must be `4` or `6` â€“ if `options` is not provided, then IPv4
and IPv6 addresses are both returned if found.

With the `all` option set to `true`, the arguments for `callback` change to
`(err, addresses)`, with `addresses` being an array of objects with the
properties `address` and `family`.

On error, `err` is an [`Error`][] object, where `err.code` is the error code.
Keep in mind that `err.code` will be set to `'ENOENT'` not only when
the hostname does not exist but also when the lookup fails in other ways
such as no available file descriptors.

`dns.lookup()` does not necessarily have anything to do with the DNS protocol.
The implementation uses an operating system facility that can associate names
with addresses, and vice versa. This implementation can have subtle but
important consequences on the behavior of any Node.js program. Please take some
time to consult the [Implementation considerations section][] before using
`dns.lookup()`.

Example usage:

```js
const dns = require('dns');
const options = {
  family: 6,
  hints: dns.ADDRCONFIG | dns.V4MAPPED,
};
dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, address, family) =>
  console.log('address: %j family: IPv%s', address, family));
// address: "2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946" family: IPv6

// When options.all is true, the result will be an Array.
options.all = true;
dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, addresses) =>
  console.log('addresses: %j', addresses));
// addresses: [{"address":"2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946","family":6}]
```

If this method is invoked as its [`util.promisify()`][]ed version, and `all`
is not set to `true`, it returns a Promise for an object with `address` and
`family` properties.
