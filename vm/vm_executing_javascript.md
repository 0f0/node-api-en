<!--name=vm-->

The `vm` module provides APIs for compiling and running code within V8 Virtual
Machine contexts. It can be accessed using:

```js
const vm = require('vm');
```

JavaScript code can be compiled and run immediately or compiled, saved, and run
later.

*Note*: The vm module is not a security mechanism.
**Do not use it to run untrusted code**.
