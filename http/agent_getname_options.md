* `options` {Object} A set of options providing information for name generation
  * `host` {string} A domain name or IP address of the server to issue the request to
  * `port` {number} Port of remote server
  * `localAddress` {string} Local interface to bind for network connections
    when issuing the request
  * `family` {integer} Must be 4 or 6 if this doesn't equal `undefined`.

Get a unique name for a set of request options, to determine whether a
connection can be reused. For an HTTP agent, this returns
`host:port:localAddress` or `host:port:localAddress:family`. For an HTTPS agent,
the name includes the CA, cert, ciphers, and other HTTPS/TLS-specific options
that determine socket reusability.
