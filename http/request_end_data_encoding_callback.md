* `data` {string|Buffer}
* `encoding` {string}
* `callback` {Function}

Finishes sending the request. If any parts of the body are
unsent, it will flush them to the stream. If the request is
chunked, this will send the terminating `'0\r\n\r\n'`.

If `data` is specified, it is equivalent to calling
[`request.write(data, encoding)`][] followed by `request.end(callback)`.

If `callback` is specified, it will be called when the request stream
is finished.
