* `request` {http.IncomingMessage} Arguments for the HTTP request, as it is in
  the [`'request'`][] event
* `socket` {net.Socket} Network socket between the server and client
* `head` {Buffer} The first packet of the upgraded stream (may be empty)

Emitted each time a client requests an HTTP upgrade. If this event is not
listened for, then clients requesting an upgrade will have their connections
closed.

After this event is emitted, the request's socket will not have a `'data'`
event listener, meaning it will need to be bound in order to handle data
sent to the server on that socket.
