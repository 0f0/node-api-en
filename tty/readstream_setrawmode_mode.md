Allows configuration of `tty.ReadStream` so that it operates as a raw device.

When in raw mode, input is always available character-by-character, not
including modifiers. Additionally, all special processing of characters by the
terminal is disabled, including echoing input characters.
Note that `CTRL`+`C` will no longer cause a `SIGINT` when in this mode.

* `mode` {boolean} If `true`, configures the `tty.ReadStream` to operate as a
  raw device. If `false`, configures the `tty.ReadStream` to operate in its
  default mode. The `readStream.isRaw` property will be set to the resulting
  mode.
