* Returns: {string}

The `os.release()` method returns a string identifying the operating system
release.

*Note*: On POSIX systems, the operating system release is determined by
calling uname(3). On Windows, `GetVersionExW()` is used. Please see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname#Examples for more information.
