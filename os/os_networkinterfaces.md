* Returns: {Object}

The `os.networkInterfaces()` method returns an object containing only network
interfaces that have been assigned a network address.

Each key on the returned object identifies a network interface. The associated
value is an array of objects that each describe an assigned network address.

The properties available on the assigned network address object include:

* `address` {string} The assigned IPv4 or IPv6 address
* `netmask` {string} The IPv4 or IPv6 network mask
* `family` {string} Either `IPv4` or `IPv6`
* `mac` {string} The MAC address of the network interface
* `internal` {boolean} `true` if the network interface is a loopback or
  similar interface that is not remotely accessible; otherwise `false`
* `scopeid` {number} The numeric IPv6 scope ID (only specified when `family`
  is `IPv6`)
